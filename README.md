# Verus Engine

## What is Verus Engine?
Verus Engine is a modern, platform-agnostic 3D game engine. It is developed using **C++** and **HLSL**. It is based on **Direct3D 12** and **Vulkan** graphics APIs. The code is user friendly and well optimized. The engine is intended to be a full-featured solution for making games. It includes modules to handle input, audio, networking and other things. Hence there is no need to search for third-party libraries or write custom code.
