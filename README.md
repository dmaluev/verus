# Verus Engine

## What is Verus Engine?
Verus Engine is a modern, platform-agnostic 3D game engine. It is developed using **C++** and **HLSL**. It is based on **Direct3D 12** and **Vulkan** graphics APIs. The code is user friendly and well optimized. The engine is intended to be a full-featured solution for making games. It includes modules to handle input, audio, networking and other things. Hence there is no need to search for third-party libraries or write custom code.

## Supported systems
* **Windows 10**, 8, 8.1 *(via Vulkan renderer)*
* **64-bit only**, 32-bit is not supported

## Supported graphics libraries
* Vulkan
* Direct3D 12

## Features
* Native cross-platform code
* Same HLSL shader code for all APIs
* Deferred shading
* Efficient textures and streaming
* Large terrain support
* Built-in audio system
* Multiplayer support
* Custom user interface module
* Collision and physics support
* A bunch of post-processing effects
* Filesystem abstraction
* Other things
